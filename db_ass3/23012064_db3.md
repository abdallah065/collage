## Assignment Solution

##### Write a query that returns all orders happened in June 2021
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Sales.Orders 
WHERE orderdate BETWEEN '2021-06-01' AND '2021-06-30';
```

##### Write a query that returns orders placed on the day before the last day of the month
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Sales.Orders 
WHERE orderdate = DATEADD(DAY, -1, EOMONTH(orderdate));
```

##### Write a query that returns employees with last name containing the letter 'e' twice or more
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM HR.Employees 
WHERE lastname LIKE '%e%e%';
```

##### Write a query that returns orders with total value (qty * unitprice) greater than 10000
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Sales.OrderDetails 
WHERE qty * unitprice > 10000;
```

##### Write a query against the HR.Employees table that returns employees with a last name that starts with a lower case letter

WHERE lastname COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN LIKE '[a-z]%';
```

##### Explain the difference between the following two queries
- **Query 1**: Returns the count of orders for each employee where the order date is before May 1, 2022.
  ```sql
  SELECT empid, COUNT(*) AS numorders 
  FROM Sales.Orders 
  WHERE orderdate < '20220501' 
  GROUP BY empid;
  ```
- **Query 2**: Returns the count of orders for each employee, but only includes employees whose latest order date is before May 1, 2022.
  ```sql
  SELECT empid, COUNT(*) AS numorders 
  FROM Sales.Orders 
  GROUP BY empid 
  HAVING MAX(orderdate) < '20220501';
  ```

##### Write a query that returns the three ship countries with the highest average freight for orders placed in 2021
```sql
SELECT TOP 3 shipcountry, AVG(freight) AS avgfreight 
FROM Sales.Orders 
WHERE YEAR(orderdate) = 2021 
GROUP BY shipcountry 
ORDER BY avgfreight DESC;
```

##### Calculate row numbers for orders based on order date ordering (using order id as tiebreaker) for each customer separately
```sql
SELECT orderid, custid, orderdate, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY custid ORDER BY orderdate, orderid) AS rownum 
FROM Sales.Orders;
```

##### Figure out and return for each employee the gender based on the title of courtesy
```sql
SELECT empid, 
       CASE 
           WHEN titleofcourtesy IN ('Ms.', 'Mrs.') THEN 'Female' 
           WHEN titleofcourtesy = 'Mr.' THEN 'Male' 
           ELSE 'Unknown' 
       END AS gender 
FROM HR.Employees;
```

##### Write a query that returns for each customer the customer ID and region and sort the rows in the output by region in ascending order having NULLs sorted last
```sql
SELECT custid, region 
FROM Sales.Customers 
ORDER BY CASE WHEN region IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END, region;
```
